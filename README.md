# Modelling and Control of Manipulators

This repository contains the projects developed while studying Modelling and Control of Manipulators at ECN. The development has been carried out using Matlab, Simulink and Adams.

- **Project 1:** Direct and Inverse Geometric Model of the 3R planar robot and 6DoF Cartesian Robot.
- **Project 2:** Direct and Inverse Kinematic Model of the RX90 Robot.
- **Project 3:** Scara Robot Trajectory Generator; PID and Torque Control Law.
- **Project 4:** Interfacing ADAMS with MATLAB.
- **Project 5:** Simulation and Control of a Kuka LWR Robot using MATLAB and ADAMS.
